Any living beings are dusted with Dao heart, they are not willing to do this, they become powerful and even live forever by enlightening Dao through practice. The Avenue of Heaven and Earth is like luck, where the able live. The road to the great road is the road to struggle for the road, which has caused the struggle of all races and souls.
