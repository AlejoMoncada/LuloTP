1998. A man by the name of Albert James leaves a thick biography on the desk of Javier, a successful publisher. It is the story of Javier's mother he never knew, Amelia Garayoa. Before fate can finally reunite mother and son, Amelia will have taken a long journey, starting in tumultuous Madrid of 1934. First forced into marriage, then with her newborn baby taken from her, well-off Amelia meets Pierre, a charismatic young French journalist and revolutionary whom Amelia accompanies to Buenos Aires out of love and sheer lust for adventure. There, opera diva Carla Alessandrini takes Amelia under her arm, becoming the young Spanish woman's surrogate mother and best friend. Amelia's lifelong personal, romantic and political journey as a spy for a noble cause eventually takes her full circle back home to Madrid--but not before life-changing experiences every step of the way in Moscow, London, Rome, Paris and Berlin.<\/p>","updated":1615291665,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/api.tvmaze.com\/shows\/44664"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https:\/\/api.tvmaze.com\/episodes\/2000995"}}}},"38":{"show":{"id":46278,"url":"https:\/\/www.tvmaze.com\/shows\/46278\/realtimelove","name":"Real:Time:Love","type":"Scripted","language":"Korean","genres":["Drama","Comedy","Romance"],"status":"Ended","runtime":15,"averageRuntime":12,"premiered":"2019-08-25","ended":"2021-01-08","officialSite":"https:\/\/tv.naver.com\/whatwomenwant","schedule":{"time":"20:00","days":["Friday"]},"rating":{"average":null},"weight":56,"network":null,"webChannel":{"id":30,"name":"Naver TVCast","country":{"name":"Korea, Republic of","code":"KR","timezone":"Asia\/Seoul"},"officialSite":"https:\/\/tv.naver.com\/"},"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":null,"thetvdb":null,"imdb":null},"image":{"medium":"https:\/\/static.tvmaze.com\/uploads\/images\/medium_portrait\/284\/711138.jpg","original":"https:\/\/static.tvmaze.com\/uploads\/images\/original_untouched\/284\/711138.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Real Time Love sitcom-like web drama that follows the honest, curious stories of 18-year-olds.\u00a0<\/p>","updated":1610308004,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/api.tvmaze.com\/shows\/46278"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https:\/\/api.tvmaze.com\/episodes\/1988188"}}}},"39":{"show":{"id":52285,"url":"https:\/\/www.tvmaze.com\/shows\/52285\/red-light","name":"Red Light","type":"Scripted","language":"Dutch","genres":["Drama","Crime","Thriller"],"status":"Ended","runtime":48,"averageRuntime":48,"premiered":"2020-12-04","ended":"2021-02-05","officialSite":"https:\/\/streamz.be\/streamz\/red-light~p69f3e74f-76f0-44c5-a255-e1683a14bde1","schedule":{"time":"","days":["Friday"]},"rating":{"average":null},"weight":76,"network":null,"webChannel":{"id":410,"name":"Streamz","country":{"name":"Belgium","code":"BE","timezone":"Europe\/Brussels"},"officialSite":null},"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":null,"thetvdb":389426,"imdb":"tt10795304"},"image":{"medium":"https:\/\/static.tvmaze.com\/uploads\/images\/medium_portrait\/353\/882569.jpg","original":"https:\/\/static.tvmaze.com\/uploads\/images\/original_untouched\/353\/882569.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Three women get caught in the world of human trafficking, prostitution and organised crime when one their husbands disappears.
