It was protected by the Sword of Logos, a sect of swordsmen tasked with protecting the book to keep the world in balance. However, thousands of years ago, the Megiddo attacked and tried to steal it. As a result, the Book vanished, and each of its pages scattered across the world. In the present day, young novelist Touma Kamiyama has been having dreams of another dimension, swordsmen and monsters coming out of a storybook, and a \"mysterious girl\" calling for help. Recalling the dream sends chills down his spine, not knowing anything about the dream. One day, a strange phenomenon occurred without notice; a part of the city disappeared, people's loved ones disappear one after another, and sends the entire nation into chaos. The vanished part of the city appeared in an alternate dimension, called Wonder World, an endless dimension as big as pages from a book. The dimension is home to magical creatures that attack without hesitation, sending the people in fear and confusion. As Touma and Mei are caught in this phenomenon, the attack reminds Touma of his dream as he is attacked by a mysterious monster. \"I will definitely bring the city back to the original world!\" As if it was responding to his very will, Touma harnesses the power of the red Dragon as it merges into his body, turning him into the Swordsman of Fire.

The first UFC event was held on November 12, 1993 at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado. The purpose of the early UFC competitions was to identify the most effective martial art in a real fight between competitors of different fighting disciplines, including boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Sambo, wrestling, Muay Thai, karate, judo, and other styles. In subsequent competitions, fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline, which indirectly helped create an entirely separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts.<\/p>","updated":1661666143,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/api.tvmaze.com\/shows\/1596"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https:\/\/api.tvmaze.com\/episodes\/2343873"},"nextepisode":{"href":"https:\/\/api.tvmaze.com\/episodes\/2343874"}}}}}}
